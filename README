NAME
    Cvs::Simple - Perl interface to cvs.

VERSION
    version 0.07_04

SYNOPSIS
      use Cvs::Simple;

      # Basic usage:
      chdir('/path/to/sandbox')
        or die "Failed to chdir to sandbox:$!";
      my($cvs) = Cvs::Simple->new();
      $cvs->add('file.txt');
      $cvs->commit();

      # Callback

      my($commit_callback);
      my($commit) = 0;
      {
        my($file) = 'file.txt';
        ($commit_callback) = sub {
          my($cmd,$arg) = @_;
          if($arg=~/Checking in $file;/) { ++$commit }
        };
      }
      my($cvs) = Cvs::Simple->new();
      $cvs->callback(commit => $commit_callback);
      $cvs->add('file.txt');
      $cvs->commit();
      croak "Failed to commit file.txt" unless($commit);
      $cvs->unset_callback('commit');

DESCRIPTION
    "Cvs::Simple" is an attempt to provide an easy-to-use wrapper that
    allows cvs commands to be executed from within a Perl program, without
    the programmer having to wade through the (many) cvs global and
    command-specific options.

    The methods provided follow closely the recipes list in "Pragmatic
    Version Control with CVS" by Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt (see
    <http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/starter_kit/vcc/index.html>).

  UTILITY METHODS
    new ( [ CONFIG_ITEMS ] )
        Creates an instance of Cvs::Simple.

        CONFIG_ITEMS is a hash of configuration items. Recognised
        configuration items are:

        cvs_bin
        external
        callback

        See the method descriptions below for details of these. If none are
        specified, CVS::Simple will choose some sensible defaults.

    callback ( CMD, CODEREF )
        Specify a function pointed to by CODEREF to be executed for every
        line output by CMD.

        Permitted values of CMD are "All" (executed on every line of
        output), "add", "commit", "checkout", "diff", "update". CMD is also
        permitted to be undef, in which case, it will be assumed to be
        "All".

        cvs_cmd passes two arguments to callbacks: the actual command
        called, and the line returned by CVS.

        See the tests for examples of callbacks.


    unset_callback ( CMD )
        Remove the callback set for CMD.

    cvs_bin ( PATH )
        Specifies the location and name of the CVS binary. Default to
        "/usr/bin/cvs".

    cvs_cmd ( )
        cvs_cmd() does the actual work of calling the equivalent CVS
        command. If any callbacks have been set, they will be executed for
        every line received from the command. If no callbacks have been set,
        all output is to STDOUT.

    external( REPOSITORY )
        Specify an "external" repository. This can be a genuinely remote
        repository in ":ext:user@repos.tld:/path/to/cvsroot" format, or an
        alternative repository on the local host. This will be passed to the
        "-d" CVS global option.

  CVS METHODS
    add ( FILE1, [ .... , FILEx ] )
    add_bin ( FILE1, [ .... , FILEx ] )
        Add a file or files to the repository; equivalent to "cvs add file1,
        ....", or "cvs add -kb file1, ..." in the case of add_bin().

    co ( TAG, MODULE )
          Alias for checkout()

    checkout ( MODULE )
    checkout ( TAG, MODULE )
          Note that co() can be used as an alias for checkout().

    ci
          Alias for commit().

    commit ( )
    commit ( FILELIST_ARRAYREF )
    commit ( TAG )
    commit ( TAG, FILELIST_ARRAYREF )
        These are the equivalent of "cvs commit -m """, "cvs commit -m ""
        file1, file2, ...., fileN", "cvs commit -r TAG -m """ and "cvs
        commit -r TAG -m "" file1, file2, ...., fileN" respectively.

        Note that ci() can be used as an alias for commit().

    diff ( FILE_OR_DIR )
    diff ( TAG1, TAG2, FILE_OR_DIR )
        FILE_OR_DIR is a single file, or a directory, in the sandbox.

        Performs context diff: equivalent to "cvs diff -c FILE_OR_DIR" or
        "cvs diff -c -rTAG1 -rTAG2 FILE_OR_DIR".

    merge ( OLD_REV, NEW_REV, FILENAME )
        This is the equivalent of "cvs -q update -jOLD_REV -jNEW_REV
        FILENAME". Note for callback purposes that this is actually an
        update().

    backout ( CURRENT_REV, REVERT_REV, FILENAME )
    undo ( CURRENT_REV, REVERT_REV, FILENAME )
        Reverts from CURRENT_REV to REVERT_REV. Equivalent to "cvs update
        -jCURRENT_REV -jREVERT_REV FILENAME".

        Note that backout() can be used as an alias for undo().

        Note that for callback purposes this is actually an update().

    upd
          Alias for update().

    update ( )
    update ( FILE1, [ ...., FILEx ] );
        Equivalent to "cvs -q update -d" and "cvs -d update file1, ...,
        filex".

        Note that updates to a specific revision ("-r") and sticky-tag
        resets ("-A") are not currently supported.

        Note that upd() is an alias for update().

    up2date ( )
        Short-hand for "cvs -nq update -d".

    status ( )
    status( file1 [, ..., ... ] )
        Equivalent to "cvs status -v".

  EXPORT
    None by default.

LIMITATIONS AND CAVEATS
    1. Note that "Cvs::Simple" carries out no input validation; everything
    is passed on to CVS. Similarly, the caller will receive no response on
    the success (or otherwise) of the transaction, unless appropriate
    callbacks have been set.
    2. The "cvs_cmd" method is quite simplistic; it's basically a pipe from
    the equivalent CVS command line (with STDERR redirected). If a more
    sophisticated treatment, over-ride "cvs_cmd", perhaps with something
    based on "IPC::Run" (as the Cvs package does).
    3. This version of "Cvs::Simple" has been developed against cvs version
    1.11.19. Command syntax may differ in other versions of cvs, and
    "Cvs::Simple" method calls may fail in unpredictable ways if other
    versions are used. Cross-version compatibiility is something I intend to
    address in a future version.
    4. The "diff", "merge", and "undo" methods lack proper tests. More tests
    are required generally.
